# Lunarfig.nvim

For lazy people who would like to configure [Lunarvim](https://lunarvim.org)
with JSON, similar to how `settings.json` works with VSCode.

## Why Lunarfig?

This plugin is mainly geared toward developers coming from a VSCode-like
experience who are used to the convenience of `settings.json`. It took a long
time for me to ditch VSCode for Neovim, despite wanting to do so for years. Vim
is notorious for having a steep learning curve, but even after learning the
basic movements, there is the additional hurdle of configuring your Vim editor
to be just right.

Projects such as Lunarvim have tried to lower this barrier by providing a
preconfigured Neovim experience. This is a Lunarvim specific plugin, which you
can think of as an attempt to lower the barrier even further.

I don't expect anyone other than myself to use this, but it would be awesome to
see if others are interested in this project.

## Usage
